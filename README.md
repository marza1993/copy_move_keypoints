# copy_move_keypoints
Copy-move detection through SIFT key-points matching and spatial clustering with DBSCAN algorithm, similar to what Amerini et al. did in their original paper 
["A SIFT-Based Forensic Method for Copyâ€“Move Attack Detection and Transformation Recovery"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224225329_A_SIFT-Based_Forensic_Method_for_Copy-Move_Attack_Detection_and_Transformation_Recovery).
